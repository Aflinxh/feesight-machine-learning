# Welcome to FeeSight - Machine Learning

This is our Colab Notebook script for building a model to predict asset close price: crypto & stocks.

## Let's Get Started

Follow the steps below, and don't miss anything:

1. Clone this repository via the command prompt
   ```sh
   https://github.com/Aflinxh/feesight-machine-learning
   ```
2. Navigate to the Asset Prediction folder, open that folder then choose one of two subfolder that you want to try to run. For example, if you want to try running the stock prediction then choose the stock subfolder. 
3. Import one of `.ipynb` from the subfolder that you choose in step 2 into Google Colab. For example, if you choose the stock subfolder and want to try running the bbca stock prediction, you should import the `predict_bbca.ipynb` into Google Colab.
4. Run the code in the notebook in the specified order.

## How to Test the Model?
1. Make sure the .ipynb has access to .h5 file
2. Go to the last cell code sequence in the notebook and run it. Then, input the date with format YYYY-MM-DD.
